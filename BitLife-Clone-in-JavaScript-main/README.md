## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Electron.js

## Project Overview
I am recreating the popular mobile game "BitLife" using JavaScript. Although I chose the challenging route of writing it in pure vanilla JS, the process has been a lot of fun, and I am optimistic about completing it one day. The entire application will be web-based and more simplified compared to the original version.
